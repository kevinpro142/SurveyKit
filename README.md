## Usage 📦

Using SurveyKit in your SwiftUI app is straightforward and intuitive. You can quickly incorporate surveys into your app by following these simple steps:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SurveyKit

struct SurveyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        SurveyView(survey: Survey()) { result in
            // Handle survey result here
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, `Survey()` represents a sample survey object. You can customize this object with different questions, themes, and logic to create engaging surveys tailored to your app's needs.

## Example 🌟

Here's a sneak peek at how you can create a simple survey using SurveyKit:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SurveyKit

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                Text("Welcome to Our Survey")
                    .font(.title)
                SurveyView(survey: Survey()) { result in
                    // Handle survey result here
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Take the Survey")
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, `ContentView` displays a welcome message followed by the SurveyView, where users can interact with the survey questions and provide their responses.
